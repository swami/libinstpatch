## 1. What is libInstPatch?

libInstPatch stands for lib-Instrument-Patch and is a library for processing digital sample based MIDI instrument "patch" files.
The types of files libInstPatch supports are used for creating instrument sounds for wavetable synthesis. libInstPatch provides
an object framework (based on GObject) to load patch files into, which can then be edited, converted, compressed and saved.

More information can be found on the libInstPatch Wiki pages on the Project Swami website.
